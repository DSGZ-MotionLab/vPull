# vPull

## Overview

vPull is a Python project that implements a vision-based 3D pose tracking for automated clinical pull test analysis in Parkinson's disease and related movement disorders. 

## Features

- Timing and amplitude of pull execution   
- Timing and amplitude of stepping response 
- Amplitude of retropulsion and latency of balance recovery 

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vPull.git
    cd vPull
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data**:
    - Ensure you have the properties file (`vPull_properties.json`) and the sample keypoint data file (`sample_data.json`) in the project directory.

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Main script to run the analysis.
- `vPull_utils.py`: Utility functions for the analysis.
- `vPull_properties.json`: Properties for the analysis including filter settings and thresholds.
- `sample_data.json`: Sample keypoint data for testing.

## Configuration

### `vPull_properties.json`
This file contains the configuration for the analysis:

### `sample_data.json`
This file contains the sample keypoint data structured as a 3D array with the following dimensions:
- Number of keypoints
- Each keypoint contains: timestamp, x, y, z, keypoint_confidence
- Number of frames

## Example Output

The analysis script (`main.py`) will output a dictionary containing the following metrics:
```json
{
    "pull_onset": 1.2,
    "pull_magnitude": 2.5,
    "1st_step_latency": 0.8,
    "1st_step_duration": 0.5,
    "1st_step_length": 0.3,
    "step_number": 3,
    "bending_amplitude": 10.5,
    "bending_latency": 0.7,
    "recovered": true,
    "recover_latency": 1.5
}
```
